# 🏥 Diabetes Prediction Model
## 📌 Overview
Stark Health Clinic integrates machine learning to enhance disease detection, optimize resources, and improve patient outcomes. Diabetes poses significant health and financial challenges, and current detection methods lack precision. This project develops a predictive model for early intervention and cost reduction.

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes risk, enabling early detection and targeted preventive measures.

### 📊 Dataset & Privacy

### Data Source
Patient records including demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and lab results.

# Privacy Compliance
Data anonymized to comply with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.

## 🏗️ Methodology

## 🔹 Data Preprocessing
## Loading Data
Used pandas.read_csv for data import.
### Feature Engineering
Selected key predictors for diabetes risk.
### Normalization
Scaled continuous features to improve model performance.
## 🔹 Model Development
Implemented multiple ML algorithms:
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
Neural Networks
Logistic Regression

## 🔹 Model Evaluation
Assessed performance using key metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimization.

## 🔹 Deployment & Integration
Integrated into Stark Health’s system for real-time predictions.
Established a framework for continuous monitoring and retraining.

## 📌 Key Findings

## 🔍 Data Insights
No Missing Values: Verified using isnull().sum().
Outlier Detection: Boxplots revealed high-risk patients based on blood glucose, BMI, and age.
Correlation Matrix: Blood glucose and HbA1c were the strongest predictors.

##  📉 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC

## 📌 Next Steps
Adjust classification thresholds for better recall.
Address class imbalance using SMOTE or weighted loss functions.
Implement ensemble methods to boost accuracy.
