Diabetes Prediction Model

Background

Stark Health Clinic is a leading healthcare provider dedicated to enhancing patient care through technology and predictive modeling. By integrating machine learning into its operations, the clinic aims to improve disease detection, optimize resource allocation, and drive better health outcomes.

Diabetes presents a major health challenge for Stark Health’s patients, carrying significant medical and financial implications. Current early detection methods lack precision, resulting in missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address this, the clinic seeks to develop an advanced diabetes prediction model that enables proactive patient management and reduces long-term healthcare costs.

Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts an individual's risk of developing diabetes. By analyzing patient data and identifying key risk factors, the model will support early detection efforts, allowing for targeted preventive measures and improved clinical decision-making.

Method

As a Data Scientist leading this initiative, the project involves:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Aggregating patient data, including demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and laboratory results, ensuring data quality and compliance.
•	Dataset Loading: I loaded a diabetes prediction dataset using pandas.read_csv.
Feature Engineering: Identifying and selecting the most relevant predictors for diabetes risk.

Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to develop an accurate predictive model.

Model Evaluation & Validation: Assessing model performance using key metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.

Deployment & Integration: Collaborating with clinical teams to integrate the model into Stark Health’s healthcare system, enabling real-time predictions and actionable insights.

Continuous Monitoring & Improvement: Establishing a framework for ongoing model monitoring, retraining, and refinement based on real-world data.

Expected Impact

By implementing this diabetes risk prediction model, Stark Health Clinic aims to:

Enhance Early Detection: Improve the accuracy of diabetes diagnosis at an earlier stage.

Optimize Patient Outcomes: Enable timely interventions and personalized treatment plans.

Reduce Healthcare Costs: Minimize long-term financial burdens associated with diabetes complications.

Support Proactive Healthcare: Empower medical professionals with data-driven insights to take preventive action.

This initiative represents a significant step toward transforming diabetes management through AI-driven predictive analytics, reinforcing Stark Health Clinic’s commitment to innovation and excellence in patient care.



### Findings of the Process 
 1. Dataset Exploration and Cleaning
•	Initial Data Review: Using head(), tail(), and sample(), you explored the structure of the data and observed that there are 10 columns with various features (e.g., gender, age, bmi, HbA1c_level, etc.).
•	Missing Values: No missing values were identified using isnull().sum(). A heatmap of missing values confirmed the data is complete.
•	Outlier Detection: Boxplots of features like blood_glucose_level, bmi, age, and HbA1c_level revealed significant outliers in bmi and blood_glucose_level. These outliers suggest some extreme cases, possibly indicating high-risk patients.

2. Univariate Analysis
•	Gender: The majority of the dataset is female, with a small proportion of males and other genders.
•	Hypertension: Most patients do not have hypertension.
•	Heart Disease: Similarly, most patients do not have heart disease.
•	Diabetes: The target variable, diabetes, shows that most patients do not have diabetes.
•	Smoking History: A significant number of records lack information about smoking history. Among those with information, many patients either do not smoke or have quit.
•	Age and BMI Groups: Age is grouped into categories, with the highest count in the elderly (65 and above) group. Similarly, BMI is categorized, with most patients falling into the 'Healthy weight' and 'Overweight' categories.

3. Bivariate Analysis
•	I  visualized how different factors (e.g., age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history) correlate with the target variable (diabeteslabel4, relabeled from diabetes).
•	Several visualizations, including bar plots and count plots with hue, were generated to show relationships between features and diabetes status.
•	Gender-wise, there were more female patients diagnosed with diabetes, and certain age groups (older adults) were more likely to be diabetic.

4. Multivariate Analysis
•	Aggregated and visualized data based on diabetes status (diabeteslabel4) for different features like BMI, age, hypertension, heart disease, etc.
•	Plots compared the total values for bmi, age, and gender based on diabetes status.
•	Insights show that individuals with higher BMI or advanced age are more likely to develop diabetes, and that hypertension and heart disease co-occur with diabetes.

5. Correlation Matrix
•	A heatmap of the correlation matrix was created, showing key relationships between different features.
•	Strongest correlations: Blood glucose level and HbA1c level (0.42), both key predictors of diabetes.
•	Moderate correlations: Age, hypertension, BMI, and heart disease, all showing some links to diabetes risk.

6. Feature Engineering
•	The features were preprocessed, including encoding categorical variables (gender, smoking_history).
•	Continuous features (bmi, blood_glucose_level, etc.) were normalized using Min-Max scaling to mitigate outliers.

7. Model Training and Evaluation
•	The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
•	Logistic Regression: A logistic regression model was trained and evaluated, providing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
•	Random Forest: Another model, Random Forest, was trained, and similar evaluation metrics were calculated.
•	Confusion Matrix: Both models' confusion matrices were visualized, with the logistic regression model showing a high true negative rate but some false negatives.

8. Comparison of Multiple Models
•	Several classifiers were tested, including:
o	XGBoost
o	Random Forest
o	K-Nearest Neighbors
o	SGD Classifier
o	Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
o	Naive Bayes
o	Decision Tree
o	Logistic Regression
•	The performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC) for each classifier were calculated and stored in dictionaries.

9. Further Analysis and Next Steps
•	The script explores the potential for adjusting the classification threshold to improve sensitivity.
•	You also proposed using additional evaluation metrics, such as F1-score or Recall, to balance false negatives and false positives, particularly for diabetes detection.

Conclusion & Model Performance

•	Key Insights: Blood glucose levels and HbA1c are the most significant predictors for diabetes. Age and BMI also play important roles, though to a lesser extent.
•	Model Performance: The Logistic Regression model performed well overall, but there is room for improvement, especially in reducing false negatives (missed diabetic cases).
•	Next Steps: Possible improvements include adjusting the classification threshold, using more advanced algorithms, and exploring additional features to improve diabetes prediction.

Strengths:
The model demonstrates high accuracy and strong specificity, meaning it effectively identifies non-diabetic individuals with minimal false positives.

Weaknesses:
A relatively high number of false negatives indicates that some diabetic cases are being missed, which is a critical concern in medical applications.

Areas for Improvement:
Enhancing Recall (Sensitivity): The model should be optimized to correctly identify more diabetic cases.

Potential Solutions:
Adjusting the decision threshold to favor recall over precision.
Implementing cost-sensitive learning to penalize misclassification of diabetic cases.
Using ensemble methods to improve overall predictive performance.

Final Thoughts:
While the model performs well overall, the presence of false negatives poses a risk in a healthcare setting where missing a diabetes diagnosis can have severe consequences. Further refinements, such as addressing class imbalance and tuning hyperparameters, can improve its effectiveness in detecting diabetic patients.
